Hello! Here is how to setup your local machine to run this Python 3 code executor:

Start the backend:
- Clone this repo
- cd backend
- python -m venv venv
- .\venv\Scripts\activate (For Windows)
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- uvicorn main:app --reload

Start the frontend:
- cd my-code-execution-app
- npm run dev

If anything goes wrong, I also attached a picture of the working website in this repo named "Project Demo".
